# Spectate Enemies Zoom Fix
This small mod improves/fixes zooming in the [Spectate Enemies](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AllToasters/SpectateEnemies/) mod.

Now instead of the zoom simply moving the camera's pivot/focus point up or down, it instead moves the camera closer or further from the specated enemy.
This should be much more intuitive.
