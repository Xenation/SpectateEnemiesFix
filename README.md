# SpectateEnemiesFix
This repo is for a small Lethal Company mod that fixes the weird zoom of the [Spectate Enemies](https://github.com/EBro912/SpectateEnemies/) mod.

Write an issue if you have any feedback to provide or bug to report.

### Project Setup
This repo does not contain any of the third party DLLs required for the build, you will have to add them yourself into the `Ext/` folder.
